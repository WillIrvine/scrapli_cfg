# scrapli_cfg

scrapli_cfg makes merging or replacing device configurations over Telnet or SSH easy. Why over Telnet or SSH? 
Because you pretty much will always have one of these options available to you, whereas you may not have eAPI or 
NETCONF ready and enabled (think day zero provisioning, or crazy security requirements locking down ports).

scrapli_cfg is built on top of scrapli "core" and continues the "look and feel" of scrapli into the config 
management side of things.
